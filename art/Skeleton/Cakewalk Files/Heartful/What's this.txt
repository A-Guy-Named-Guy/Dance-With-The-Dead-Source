This song isn't complete. Was considering doing a fourth song, and although I do love how this one sounds (and I'd like
to prove that I can write something in a key other than C Major), I ultimately scrapped it purely because I don't want to
have to chart another 5/4 song in the default charter.

And let it be known here: I shall not be impressed by a new charter until someone adds a function to change the chart's
time signature (because by god does it suck if your song isn't 4/4 time).
