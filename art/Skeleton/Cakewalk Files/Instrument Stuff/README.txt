Hello! Thanks for snooping a bit, went the extra mile to put some of the music stuff I've done in here.
I'm assuming putting the VSTs I used in here directly may be technically illegal (the worst kind of illegal), so for most of
this stuff I'm gonna settle for linking websites.

Skeleton Sophia's Voice - Sonatina Orchestra (Xylophone) 
Sonatina Download: https://plugins4free.com/plugin/2541/ (Not the exact place I downloaded at, if something's weird just
google the vst and look for a different download)

Boyfriend's Voice - This guy's game banana page: https://gamebanana.com/tools/7009 (Thank you Mint Breath!)

Theremin - Spook Keys: https://www.kvraudio.com/product/spook_keys_by_simple_media

Synthesizer - Vital Synth: https://vital.audio/#getvital (This is needed for those Vital files to be useful)

I made all those Synth instruments myself, though do note that not necessarily all of them got used. Hopefully, the cakewalk
files saved which synth presets were used, so you won't need to organize stuff if you want to mess with things.
