Hello! I'm fairly new to this sort of developing process, so sorry if this readme is too unprofessional.

This is the source code for Friday Night Funkin - Dancing With the Dead! (VS Sophia) mod. Feel free to snoop around in here, there's some bonus goodies in the first art folder, around where you'd formerly find the FlashFiles.
